# Appendix

Last Updated: 2026-04-07

## Authentication

- Header `Appid`: merchant application identifier
- Header `Timestamp`: current request timestamp in milliseconds
- Header `Sign`: request signature generated from the request body

## Common Conventions

- All published API v2 routes use `POST`.
- Time fields are integer timestamps unless the field comment says otherwise.
- List interfaces commonly use `nextId` as the pagination cursor.
- Amount, price and fee fields are strings in proto definitions and should be handled as decimal strings.
